                    <p>Global warming, the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature, is 
                        primarily driven by a complex interplay of human activities and natural processes. 
                        Though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly
                         increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels. As the human 
                         population has increased, so has the volume of fossil fuels burned. Fossil fuels 
                         include coal, oil, and natural gas, and burning them causes what is known as the 
                         <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/greenhouse-effect-101#gases"><i>“greenhouse effect”</i></a> in Earth atmosphere. The greenhouse effect is when the sun rays 
                         penetrate the atmosphere, but when that heat is reflected off the surface cannot escape
                          back into space. Gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels prevent the heat from
                           leaving the atmosphere. These greenhouse gasses are carbon dioxide, 
                           chlorofluorocarbons(CFCs), water vapor, methane, and nitrous oxide. The excess heat 
                           in the atmosphere has caused the average global temperature to rise overtime, 
                           otherwise known as global warming.</p>

                    <p>The most significant human-induced cause is the release of greenhouse gases into the 
                        atmosphere, with carbon dioxide (CO2) being the primary culprit. This stems from the 
                        burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation, as well as industrial processes,
                         which collectively contribute to a substantial CO2 buildup. <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/methane-emissions-are-driving-climate-change-heres-how-reduce-them">
                            Methane emissions</a> from 
                         sources like agriculture, livestock, and natural gas production are another critical 
                         factor, as methane has a much higher heat-trapping potential than CO2 in the short term.
                          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation">Deforestation</a> and land-use changes lead to the release of stored carbon in trees and
                           soil. Industrial activities, such as cement production, also emit CO2. Moreover, 
                           agricultural practices involving synthetic fertilizers and rice cultivation release
                            methane into the atmosphere. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill"><i>Landfills</i></a> contribute methane emissions when organic 
                            waste decomposes without oxygen. The removal of forests and natural vegetation 
                            reduces the Earth's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide through the process of 
                            photosynthesis. This results in the release of stored carbon, further increasing 
                            atmospheric CO2 levels. Additionally, land-use changes such as <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-022-00924-y">urbanization</a> and 
                            agriculture not only reduce the planet's ability to absorb carbon but also 
                            increase the albedo, or reflectivity, of the Earth's surface. Albedo changes 
                            contribute to local and regional warming by affecting the way solar radiation 
                            is absorbed and reflected, certain synthetic fluorinated gases used in 
                            refrigeration and manufacturing, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorinated_gases"><i>"F-gases"</i></a>, have a high global warming 
                            potential. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_effects_of_transport#:~:text=The%20environmental%20effects%20of%20transport,through%20emission%20of%20carbon%20dioxide.">
                                transportation sector</a> relies on gasoline and diesel fuels, 
                            further adding to CO2 emissions. Meanwhile, the energy sector's dependence on 
                            fossil fuels exacerbates global warming, as does energy consumption in industries 
                            and residential settings. Pollution, such as black carbon settling on ice and snow, 
                            reduces their reflectivity and accelerating melting.</p>

                           change</i></a>. Sometimes these phrases are used interchangeably, however, they are different.
                            Climate change refers to changes in weather patterns and growing seasons around the 
                            world. It also refers to sea level rise caused by the expansion of warmer seas and 
                            melting ice sheets and glaciers. Global warming causes climate change, which poses a 
                            serious threat to life on Earth in the forms of widespread flooding and extreme 
                            weather.</p>
