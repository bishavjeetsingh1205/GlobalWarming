                <p>The effects of human-caused global warming are happening now, are irreversible for people alive today, and will worsen as long as humans add greenhouse gases to the
                     atmosphere. Global climate change is not a future problem. <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/climate-scientists-world-we-have-only-20-years-theres-no-turning-back">
                        Climate scientists have concluded</a> that we must limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2040 Changes to Earth climate driven by increased human 
                        emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are 
                     already having widespread effects on the environment: glaciers and ice sheets are shrinking, river and lake ice is breaking up earlier, plant and animal 
                     geographic ranges are shifting, and plants and trees are blooming sooner. Effects that scientists had long predicted would result from global climate change are 
                     now occurring, such as sea ice loss, accelerated sea level rise, and longer, more intense heat waves, etc. For-example, scientists concludedthat a lengthy drought

                     </a>has been intensified to 15-20 perecnt by global warming. Global warming, a long-term increase in 
                     the average 
                     temperature of the Earth's climate, has become one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time. While the causes and potential solutions to global 
                     warming are widely discussed, it is crucial to examine the immediate and long-term effects of this phenomenon on our planet. This paper will provide a 
                     comprehensive overview of the devastating effects of global warming, ranging from rising temperatures and extreme weather events to biodiversity loss and sea 
                     level rise.</p><img src="efects.png" width="700px"><br>

                <h2>Different Effects of Global Warming :</h2>
                <h3>Rising Temperatures</h3>
                <p>One of the most evident and immediate effects of global warming is the rise in average temperatures across the globe. Over the past century, the Earth's surface 
                    temperature has increased by approximately 1.2°C (2.2°F). This warming trend is expected to continue and accelerate in the coming decades. 
                    <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature">Higher temperatures</a> have
                     far-reaching consequences for various aspects of our environment and society.<br>

                    a. Heatwaves: &nbsp;Rising temperatures contribute to more frequent and severe heatwaves. These events can have severe health implications, especially for 
                    vulnerable populations, such as the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elderly, young children, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions.<br>

                    b. Crop Failure: &nbsp;Increased temperatures can harm <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3124/global-climate-change-impact-on-crops-expected-within-10-years-nasa-study-finds/">
                        agricultural productivity</a> by disrupting growing seasons, reducing crop yields, and altering the distribution
                     of pests and diseases. This can &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lead to food scarcity and higher prices.<br>

                    c. Water Scarcity: &nbsp;Higher temperatures can intensify droughts and reduce water availability, leading to 
                    <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/water#:~:text=Climate%20change%20is%20exacerbating%20both,climate%20change%20are%20inextricably%20linked.">
                        water scarcity</a> in many regions. This can further 
                    exacerbate food and water security &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;issues<br></p><img src="effects graph.webp" width="1000px" height="670px"><br>

                <h3>Extreme Weather Events</h3>
                <p>Global warming is associated with an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including hurricanes, cyclones, droughts, and floods.<br>

                    a. Hurricanes and Cyclones: &nbsp;Warmer ocean waters fuel more powerful hurricanes and cyclones, resulting in greater damage when these storms make landfall. 
                    Coastal communities are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particularly at risk. United states saw an unprecedented <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/teniope-adewumi-gunn/extreme-weather-and-covid-19-protecting-our-responders">
                        22 weather and climate disasters</a> that caused at least a billion
                    dollars worth damage in 2020 but <a href="www.noaa.gov/media-release/extremely-active-2017-atlantic-hurricane-season-finally-ends"><i>2017</i></a> was the costliest on record and among deadliest as well<br>

                    b. Droughts: &nbsp;Higher temperatures can lead to more prolonged and severe <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/drought#tab=tab_1">droughts</a>. This can cause water shortages, damage to ecosystems, and agricultural 
                    losses.<br>

                    c. Flooding: &nbsp;Increased global temperatures contribute to the melting of polar ice and glaciers, raising sea levels and making coastal regions more 
                    susceptible to <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/flooding-and-climate-change-everything-you-need-know">flooding</a> during storms. This &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endangers both human communities and ecosystems.<br></p>

                <h3>Melting Polar Ice and Glaciers</h3>
                <p>Global warming has accelerated the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, particularly in the Arctic and Antarctica. This phenomenon has profound consequences for 
                    global sea levels and ecosystems.<br>

                    a. Sea Level Rise: &nbsp;The melting of ice caps and glaciers, combined with the thermal expansion of seawater, is causing 
                    <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level#:~:text=Global%20average%20sea%20level%20has,4%20inches)%20above%201993%20levels.">
                        sea levels to rise at an alarming rate</a>.
                     Rising sea levels threaten coastal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;communities and can lead to inundation and erosion.<br>

                    b. Ecosystem Disruption: &nbsp;Polar ecosystems, including those in the Arctic, are facing unprecedented disruption due to the loss of sea ice. This has severe 
                    consequences for the wildlife that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depend on these habitats, such as polar bears and penguins.<br></p>

            <div class="bhup">
                <h3>Biodiversity Loss</h3>
                <p>Global warming poses a significant threat to biodiversity by altering habitats, disrupting ecosystems, and exacerbating extinction risks.<br>

                    a. Habitat Loss: &nbsp;Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns can lead to the <a href="https://www.ifaw.org/international/journal/impact-climate-change-animals#:~:text=Habitat%20loss%3A%20Rising%20temperatures%20affect,other%20animals%20to%20die%20off.">
                        loss of critical habitats</a> for various species. For example, coral 
                    reefs are particularly vulnerable to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bleaching due to increased ocean temperatures.<br>

                    b. Altered Migration Patterns: &nbsp;As temperatures change, some species may need to alter their migration patterns to find suitable habitats. This can disrupt 
                    ecosystems and lead to population &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declines.<br>

                    c. Increased Extinction Risk: &nbsp;Many species, especially those with narrow ranges or specialized ecological niches, face an increased 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_risk_from_climate_change#:~:text=It%20suggested%20that%20between%2015,their%20survival%20range%20by%20then.">risk of extinction</a> due to
                     the rapid pace of climate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change.<br></p>

            <div class="malk">
                <h3>Ocean Acidification</h3>
                <p>Global warming is not only warming the planet but also impacting the <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/co2-and-ocean-acidification#:~:text=The%20rising%20concentration%20of%20carbon,the%20detriment%20of%20marine%20ecosystems.">
                    chemistry of our oceans</a>. Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide is being absorbed by the world's
                     oceans, leading to ocean acidification.<br>

                    a. Coral Reefs: &nbsp;Ocean acidification is particularly detrimental to coral reefs, as it weakens the calcium carbonate structures that corals rely on for their
                     survival. This threatens the health &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stability of these vital ecosystems.<br>

                    b. Marine Life: &nbsp;Acidic waters can affect the physiology of marine organisms, including mollusks and some plankton species. This can have cascading effects on
                     the entire marine food web.<br></p><img src="effects op.jpg" width="900px"><br>
